						As much as I love these old games, it has always been my dream to redesign such a game with fast and smooth gameplay in a modern look.

							<h3>Lock and Key Level Design</h3>

						<div align="justify">		
						Watching the web series Bosskeys of the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw">GameMakers Toolkit</a>
						I learned a lot about non-linear level design in games like Zelda, Dark Souls, and Metroid.
						This helped me a lot in creating my level design.
						I took over the graph system from the creator Mark Brown for creating my own level graphs.
						
						
						Any smallkey <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/smallkey.png" /></span> 
						is used to open any locked door <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/lockedoor.png" /></span>. 
						Each key object <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/keyitem.png" /></span> 
						can be used to overcome many obstacles <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/obstacle.png" /></span>. 
						And every boss key <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/bosskey.png" /></span> 
						can be used to open exactly one boss door <span class="image icon"><img src="images/bosskeys/bossdoor.png" /></span> .
						
						The example below shows a relatively simple layout for one level. 
						But with the system more complex levels are possible. 
						Since this system has helped me so much, I have developed it further, as you can see in my next project.
